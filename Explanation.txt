Challenges of the coursework

Challenge 1: Dealing with different types in the data:
    - Having different types in column a meant a significant amount of code 
    was placed on type checking. As we could not use the <assert> library, 
    this was done using if statements along witht he helper functions.
    - nullptr's: nullptr's were dealt with by ensuring they would never be dereferenced.
    For example, nullptr if statements were done in the hash table, and during sorting
    the nullptr rows were removed
